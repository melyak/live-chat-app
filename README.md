3. Time Spent
   12-15 hours
   
4. Assumptions Made
   a. User Authentication: I assumed that user authentication is handled externally, and the user information is provided to the chat application after successful                authentication. The app does not include a full authentication system for simplicity.
   b. Real-Time Communication: I assumed that the real-time communication requirements are met using WebSocket technology. The app relies on WebSocket for instant message        delivery and does not explore other real-time communication options.
   c. Data Consistency: I assumed that data consistency across multiple instances of the application is not a critical requirement. The system doesn't implement a                distributed database or a consensus algorithm.
   d. Security: I assumed that security concerns such as encryption and data validation are implemented in the production environment. The current focus is on the basic          functionality, and security measures are not thoroughly implemented in this version.
   e. User Interface: The assumption is made that the user interface is not the primary focus of this assignment, and basic styling and functionality are sufficient for          demonstration purposes.
   f. Browser Compatibility: The application is assumed to be tested and optimized for modern web browsers. Compatibility with older browsers is not considered in this           version.
   
5. Shortcuts/Compromises Made
   a. Database Indexing: Due to time constraints, I made a compromise on database indexing. In a production environment, especially with a large number of messages, proper       indexing on fields like roomId and timestamp would be essential for optimal query performance. In this version, indexing has been kept minimal for simplicity.
   b. Error Handling: The error handling in the current version is basic. In a real-world scenario, comprehensive error handling and logging would be implemented to              capture and address various potential issues. For example, database connection errors, failed message deliveries, or malformed socket events.
   c. Scalability: While the application has been designed to handle multiple users in a room, it does not implement advanced scalability features. In a production               environment, considerations like load balancing, horizontal scaling, and distributed architecture would be explored to ensure the application scales effectively with       an increasing number of users.
   d. Security Measures: The focus of this version is on functionality rather than in-depth security. For production, additional security measures such as input                  validation, sanitation, and encryption of sensitive data should be implemented. In this version, such measures are kept to a minimum.
   e. Frontend Framework: The frontend is built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity. In a real-world scenario, a frontend framework like React, Vue, or          Angular would be used for better maintainability and a more organized code structure.
